## Play the Crush (Unused Thunder Small) Sound When Shocked



This is a gecko code that plays the unused thunder small sound, a variation of the crush sound, when the player gets shocked, just like in Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart 7. It also supports the Koopa Zapper.



Assemble this code using PyiiASMH or CodeWrite.
